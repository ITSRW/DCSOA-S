The standard WOA and some derivative algorithms are studied and experimented to solve the problem of poor results of some examples. It is proved that there is a zero searching preference trap in the "encircling" process of WOA. In addition, the chaotic initial population strategy designed by some WOA derivative algorithms is difficult to reconcile with the swarm intelligence optimization process, and the chaotic optimization algorithm itself has unbalanced search characteristics. In order to improve the above defects, two chaotic systems and "bubble net hunting" strategy are selected, and a set of fusion optimization algorithm is designed. The algorithm adopts the baseline adaptive oscillation group partition strategy based on fitness to guide the group behavior pattern, give full play to the role of chaotic system, and balance the exploration and convergence performance. Using the new algorithm to solve the international general examples and the improved examples, we can see that the performance of the algorithm is better than the contrast group algorithm, and there is no searching preference.
